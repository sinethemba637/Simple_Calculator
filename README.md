# Calculator Project

## Description
This Java-based calculator allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on two values.

## Features
- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division

## Getting Started
1. Ensure you have Java installed on your machine.
2. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/calculator.git

javac Calculator.java

java Calculator

Usage
Launch the calculator application.
Enter the first value.
Choose an operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division).
Enter the second value.
View the result.


Example
// Sample code snippet demonstrating calculator usage
public class CalculatorDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Calculator calculator = new Calculator();
        
        double result = calculator.add(5, 3);
        System.out.println("Addition: " + result);
        
        result = calculator.subtract(10, 4);
        System.out.println("Subtraction: " + result);
        
        result = calculator.multiply(7, 2);
        System.out.println("Multiplication: " + result);
        
        result = calculator.divide(15, 3);
        System.out.println("Division: " + result);
    }
}
